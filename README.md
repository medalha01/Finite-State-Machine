#### About

This repository contains a Finite State Machine (FSM) simulator implemented in Python. The simulator provides functionality for building and working with deterministic finite automata (DFA) and non-deterministic finite automata (NFA). It also includes features for determization and minimization of finite state machines.

A finite state machine is a mathematical model of computation used in various applications, such as natural language processing, compilers, and digital circuit design. This simulator can be a valuable tool for understanding and experimenting with FSMs.
